In this repository you can find three different files:

1. Tweepy Stream Listener: in this file the tweet listening is implemented, limited by number of tweets listened or time of listening desired, saving each tweet in JSON format into a .txt file.
2. Tweepy Read JSON from TXT: in this second file it's implemented the tweet reading (in JSON format) from .txt file to build a dataframe, aggregate it and plot some significant graphic about the tweets loaded.
3. Tweepy Search To Dataframe: In this files, I've also implemented the tweet searching and the building of a dataframe simultaneously instead of doing it in real time like in the Tweepy Stream Listener.
